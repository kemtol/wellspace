Coworking spaces are surely something special these days. The journey of an entrepreneur can be quite a lonely, especially when you’re bootstrapping from the ground up by yourself. At a coworking space, you are surrounded by diverse groups of freelancers, remote workers, and other independent professionals work together in a share and communal setting. Each is unique and have different stories to share, in which could benefit you in the short and long term.

You may be doing something different to them, but they too have interest in other people’s projects and could introduce you to their network that may be of use for you. This is where you build your network. At the same time, through connecting with each other, you and everybody else have the sense of being part of a community.

Having many like-minded and talented individuals around you is just one of the perks working from a coworking space.  If you are on a budget and coffeeshops are starting to get expensive, a coworking space is definitely a much better choice. With stable internet connection, conference rooms, as well as free flow of coffee, tea, water, and sometimes booze (only at certain coworking spaces), you have access to the basic necessary amenities to work.

And oh, did you also know that most coworking spaces offer their spaces based on daily, weekly rates or even month long contracts? This is perfect for everybody particularly for those who are just starting up, as you only need to commit based on how long you think you will be using the space. You definitely won’t break the bank!

So if you and your startup are still based elsewhere, you should very well be moving to a coworking space. However, if you are still not convinced, here are other perks that a certain coworking space in Jakarta can offer to you:

* Time Management
Some coworking spaces are accessible 24/7. This certain one at Kemang is available to use day and night, weekdays and weekends. If you are that workaholic, you can manage your time accordingly so that you can work at the space whenever you like.

* Weekly Talk Session
Coworking spaces would usually invite influential members of society from different industries to give a talk session to the members of the coworking space, as well as to the public who are interested to attend. Most of the speakers are those that many are actually look up to.

These events are also a good way to meet new people and learn a few new things.

* Members’ Night
At members’ night, you would gather together with the other members at the coworking space. Something you would just share the progress of your own startup, or you could have a game night with the other members, or you could just let all the stress go with a bottle of… did we mention booze earlier?
