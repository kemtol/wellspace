Workwell by wellspaces.co (previously named Freeware Spaces) is the first co-working space in Indonesia and has been actively building the entrepreneurial eco-system in Indonesia. I learnt a lot from fellow entrepreneurs and mentors from Indonesia or anywhere else. The most impressing event was the 2013’s Startup Weekend that was held by Aryo. His team has played big role in growing Indonesia’s entrepreneurial scene. I know there are lots of great companies came from workwell.
