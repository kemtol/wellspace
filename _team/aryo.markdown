Aryo Ariotedjo has been a serial entrepreneur since 2012, started out as one of the early venture capitalist in Indonesia and have supported multi million $ companies with over 1,000 employees over all the ventures he is involved in. His early passion is to help entrepreneurs grow their ventures and make them as Indonesia's prestigious business profiles. That is the big reason why he started wellspaces.co (then called Freeware Spaces) as one of the first startup incubators in Indonesia and converted the company into a full serviced service office & coworking space by 2016. He really loves to actively interact and advise all the members under wellspaces and befriending everyone within.
